A tool made for a client via our final college project.

Its a .Net application that pulls realtor listings from different websites and compiles them into an interactive table.
By clicking on a listing in the table, you can view further details such as 
- Full address
- Full Name
- Notes
  - Note Author
  - Note Content
  - Note Author Contact
- Firm in charge of the listing & contact
- links to listing

You can also save the current window, load a nother file into this window or another window, or export your file for others to see so you may share it with said others. This is all done via the menu bar.
